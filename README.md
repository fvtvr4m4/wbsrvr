more of a poc for now
goal is to write a web server from scratch in c limiting the use of external libraries (exceptions for stdio and stdlib)
current version v0 uses external libs
v1 will not use external libs
v2 will implement advanced features such as multithreading, more content types, directory listing, advanced caching
v3 will implement security features

idea is to later write a similar implementation in rust and in assembly
idea is to have a linux tailored version or a openbsd tailers version or just a unix tailored version
